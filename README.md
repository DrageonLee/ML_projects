## Overview

This repository contains various machine learning projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey in the field of ML and AI. Each project demonstrates different techniques, algorithms, and use cases, reflecting the skills and knowledge I've gained through practical, hands-on experience. The purpose of this repository is to share my progress, showcase my growing expertise, and provide insight into my approach to solving data-related problems.

More projects will be added soon. Stay tuned!

## Getting Started

All of the projects in this repository were developed and tested using Google Colab for ease of use and accessibility. Each project contains a detailed `README.md` file inside its respective folder, which provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the project, including any specific dependencies or setup required.

Simply navigate to the project folder you're interested in, and follow the instructions in the corresponding `README.md` file to get started.
